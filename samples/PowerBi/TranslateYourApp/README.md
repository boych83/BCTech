# Translations Builder

Translations Builder is an external tool created for Power BI Desktop
specifically to assist report authors and dataset authors with tasks
associated with creating translations and building multi-language
reports. **As a user**, you can install Translations Builder and use it
together with Power BI Desktop to build and test datasets and reports
that support multiple languages. **As a developer**, you can clone the
GitHub repository with the Translations Builder source code and extend
this application to meet whatever translation and localization
requirements your organization faces.
